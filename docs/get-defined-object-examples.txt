A More Complicated Definition Model

A more complicated definition model object is a template for unreliable data.

The user-defined definitions are automatically applied on the built-in ones.
Therefore, only the properties that differ must be defined by the user.

The default value "def" is returned if the property has an invalid value.

The molding process does not perform any conversion;
a value is accepted or discarded as it is.

It is the user's responsibility to carefully define the proper model.
A faulty model will produce faulty results.

The types and default values of a model:

	array:
		def: []
		isNullable: false
		isUnique: false
		model: {
			type: 'number'
		}
		limitLength: -1

		The array is limited to a single type.
		The array contains only unique values if "isUnique" is true.
		There is no limit for the count of array items
		if "limitLength" is -1.

	boolean:
		def: false
		isNullable: false

		A boolean can be a boolean or null.

	dateString:
		def: '0000-01-01'
		delimiter: '-'
		isNullable: false

		The format is "yyyy-mm-dd".
		Supports years from -9999 to 9999.
		Only a valid date is accepted as a date string.
		See "isDateString" for more information.

	dateTimeString:
		def: '0000-01-01 00:00:00'
		delimiterDate: '-'
		delimiterTime: ':'
		delimiterType: ' '
		foasType: ''
		isNullable: false

		The format is "yyyy-mm-dd hh:ss:ii".
		Supports years from -9999 to 9999.
		Only a valid date-time is accepted as a date-time string.
		See "isDateTimeString" for more information.

	number:
		def: 0
		isInt: false
		isNaNable: false
		isNullable: false
		max: Number.MAX_VALUE
		min: -Number.MAX_VALUE

		A number is a JavaScript number.
		Only integer numbers are accepted if "isInt" is true.
		The values "max" and "min" set the range of accepted values.
		A null or NaN value is not limited by "max" and "min".

	object:
		def: {}
		isNullable: false
		model: {}

		A model can have sub-models (recursive).
		The default value is not molded with the sub-model.

	string:
		def: ''
		isNullable: false
		maxChars: -1
		minChars: -1

		The values "maxChars" and "minChars"
		set the range of accepted (character) lengths.
		The lengths are calculated in Unicode characters:
		The length of string "😀" is 2 but its character length is 1.
		There is no maximum limit if "maxChars" is -1.
		There is no minimum limit if "minChars" is -1.
		A null value is not limited by "maxChars" and "minChars".

	timeString:
		def: '00:00:00'
		delimiter: ':'
		foasType: ''
		isNullable: false

		The format is "hh:ii:ss".
		An empty string is a valid time string; it means zero.
		Only a valid time is accepted as a time string.
		See "isTimeString" for more information.

Examples for the function "getDefinedObject"

1. An empty data

The data is empty.
The model defines the property "name" which is a string.
The result is an empty string for "name".

data = {};
model = {
	name: {
		type: 'string'
		// The rest of the properties (e.g. "isNullable")
		// are automatically applied from the built-in definition.
	}
};
result = { name: '' };

2. A nullable string

data = {
	name: null
};
model = {
	name: {
		type: 'string',
		def: 'The default string',
		isNullable: true
	}
};
result = { name: null };

3. An invalid value for a boolean

data = { isActive: null };
model = {
	isActive: {
		type: 'boolean',
		// "isNullable" is false by default
	}
};
result = { isActive: false };

4. A valid number

If "isNaNable" were false, the resulting number would be the default 0.

data = { age: NaN };
model = {
	age: {
		type: 'number',
		isNaNable: true
	}
};
result = { age: NaN };

5. Filter out too short and too long strings from an array

To discard an invalid item from an array,
the "def" value of the sub-model must be undefined.

data = {
	tags: ['a', 'abc', 'beta', 'beta', 'gamma', 'sixlon', 'atoolongtag']
};
model = {
	tags: {
		type: 'array',
		model: {
			type: 'string',
			def: undefined,
			maxChars: 5,
			minChars: 4
		}
	}
};
result = { tags: ['beta', 'beta', 'gamma'] };

6. Get unique integer numbers between -10 and 10.

data = {
	codes: ['a', null, -11, -5, 3.14, NaN, 8.9, 9, 10, Infinity, {}, 99 ]
};
model = {
	codes: {
		type: 'array',
		isUnique: true,
		model: {
			type: 'number',
			def: undefined,
			isInt: true,
			max: 10,
			min: -10
		}
	}
};
result = { codes: [-5, 9, 10] };

7. Valid enough data for a model with a sub-model

data = {
	age: Infinity,
	isActive: true,
	measurement: {
		height: 200,
		weight: 99.5,
		width: 80
	}
};
model = {
	age: {
		type: 'number',
		def: NaN,
		isNaNable: true,
		max: 999
	},
	isActive: {
		type: 'boolean'
	},
	measurement: {
		type: 'object',
		def: {
			height: 0,
			width: 0
		},
		model: {
			height: {
				type: 'number'
			},
			weight: {
				type: 'number'
			}
		}
	}
};
result = {
	age: NaN,
	isActive: true,
	measurement: {
		height: 200,
		weight: 99.5
	}
};

8. Valid date and time values

data = {
	date: '1999-12-31',
	dateTime: '1999-12-31 23:59:59',
	time: '23:59:59',
	minusYear: '-1999:12:31'
};
model = {
	date: {
		type: 'dateString'
	},
	dateTime: {
		type: 'dateTimeString'
	},
	time: {
		type: 'timeString'
	},
	minusYear: {
		type: 'dateString',
		delimiter: ':'
	}
};
result = {
	date: '1999-12-31',
	dateTime: '1999-12-31 23:59:59',
	time: '23:59:59',
	minusYear: '-1999:12:31'
};
